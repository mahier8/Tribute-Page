# My Tribute Page
This project attempts to capture a moment in time which should never be forgotten. Trent Alexander-Arnold's quckly taken corner against FC Barcelona leads to a decisive fourth goal.

### Why the project is useful
The project uses an image tag as well a fig caption tag to describe the image. There is then a section dedicated to the players achievements, which is listed with li tags. The final section features a blockquote and a cite tag, with the page concluding with a link to his wikipedia page. In terms of CSS, the page uses a media query. Therefore the two adjacent images disappear once the page adjusted to fit a smaller screen.
